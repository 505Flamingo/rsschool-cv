## 3. Summary

I have been working as a marketing operations manager for 2 years in state organization. All the time I perform the same tasks, so I realized that this would not lead me to success, and at the same time I know that I can do more.

I want to develop and learn new things, to increase my skills and feel the result. I made a decision to try myself in a new sphere, and also to prove myself that everything is possible when you not only want, but also do everything possible to achieve the goal.

Also I consider myself an extrovert. Writing code restrains my emotions, makes me attentive and I rest from my hyperactivity.

Start programming in 2017. Novice self-educated frontend-developer. Confident knowledge of HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript.
