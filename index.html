            <h2>3. Summary</h2>
            <p>I have been working as a marketing operations manager for 2 years in
                state organization. All the time I perform the same tasks, so I realized
                that this would not lead me to success, and at the same time I know that
                I can do more.
            </p>
            <p>I want to develop and learn new things, to increase my skills and feel
                the result. I made a decision to try myself in a new sphere, and also
                to prove myself that everything is possible when you not only want, but
                also do everything possible to achieve the goal.
            </p>
            <p>Also I consider myself an extrovert. Writing code restrains my emotions,
                makes me attentive and I rest from my hyperactivity.
            </p>
            <p>Start programming in 2017. Novice self-educated frontend-developer.
                Confident knowledge of HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript.</p>
